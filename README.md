### blockquote and figcaption
For each **blockquote** element I wanted its child **figcaption** element a little below the text and pushed to the right of its parent; I also wanted to use as few additional elements as possible. Making each **blockquote** element a flex container would necessitate making the quote text a child element, so using the "float" seemed the preferred approach <br> I started by adding the "display: block" property to the **figcaption** elements. Block elements force a line break, which accomplishes my first positioning goal of placing the **figcaptions** below the quote text. I then used "float: right" property to push the **figcaption** elements to the right of the **blockquote** container. However, these two properties conflict: by appplying a float, the newline forced by "display: block" is negated. A similar issue arrises when attempting to use "display: inline-block".<br> To finally accomplish my desired positioning, I added **br** elements after the quote text to force a line break. Since **figcaption** elements are inline, I was able to use the float property to push them to the right of the container.
